This repository highlights my journey through Java language and the programming problems that I solved during this path to foster my programming skills and also develop an intuitive way towards logic building. This is a track record of what I started after learning the C language.

I started my programming career with the C language, but C lacked in Object Oriented Programming.
So I had to choose a new language to compensate for the same.

After which I did my hands dirty on both C++ and Java to know about all the programming concepts the world uses to develop new technologies.
